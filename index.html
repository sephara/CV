    I was raised in a Pentecostal household. However, after years of personal study
    and searching for the True God, I found Him. I knew that the way I worshipped before was
    not real because it never reached my heart. It never determined my behavior becasue deep down
    I knew it was a lie. So when I learned who Jevoah really is and what His requirements
    are I was eager to please Him, not out of fear of burning forever but because I really
    love Him and I would never want to Disappoint Him.
